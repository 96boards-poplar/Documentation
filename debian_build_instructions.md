The instructions that follow describe the process for creating image
files suitable for use in a Poplar system.

## Gather required sources

First you'll gather the source code and other materials required to
build the images. These instructions assume you are using Linux based
OS on your host machine.

### Step 1: Make sure you have needed tools installed

  This list may well grow, but at least you'll need the following:

```shell
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get upgrade
      sudo apt-get install device-tree-compiler libssl-dev u-boot-tools
      sudo apt-get install screen simg2img
```

### Step 2: Set up the working directory.

```shell
  mkdir -p ~/src/poplar
  cd ~/src/poplar
  TOP=$(pwd)
```

### Step 3: Download a root file system image to use.
  These are available from Linaro, under here:
    http://snapshots.linaro.org/debian/images/stretch/developer-arm64/
  These images change regularly, and the latest version is always
  available under a folder named "latest".  For the purposes of this
  document we assume that build 80 is used.  If you download this
  file by some means other than "wget" shown below, please ensure it
  gets place in the `recovery` directory created here.

```shell
    mkdir ${TOP}/recovery
    wget -P ${TOP}/recovery \
        http://snapshots.linaro.org/debian/images/stretch/developer-arm64/80/linaro-stretch-developer-20170914-80.tar.gz
```

### Step 4: Get the source code.

```shell
  cd ${TOP}
  git clone https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware
  git clone https://github.com/96boards-poplar/poplar-tools.git
  git clone https://github.com/96boards-poplar/l-loader.git
  git clone https://github.com/96boards-poplar/u-boot.git
  git clone https://github.com/96boards-poplar/linux.git -b poplar-4.9
```

### Step 5: Set up toolchains for building
  Almost everything uses aarch64, but one item (l-loader.bin) must
  be built for 32-bit ARM.  In addition, UEFI requires the compiler
  to be no newer than GCC 4.9.  Finally, the newest versions of GCC
  warn and in some case treat as errors some things that have not been
  fixed in code that's not Poplar-specific in the Linux kernel code.
  The easiest way to avoid problems due to these requirements is to
  just use the 4.9 version of GCC for 64-bit ARM, and a stable but
  new version of GCC for 32-bit ARM.  If you already have installed
  cross-compilers, they may work for you; but the instructions
  assume you are installing the following toolchains.

  Download a 64-bit toolchain using GCC 4.9 from Linaro, and extract
  it under the /opt directory on your build system:
```shell
    cd /tmp
    wget https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/4.9-2017.01/aarch64-linux-gnu/gcc-linaro-4.9.4-2017.01-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz
    sudo mkdir -p /opt
    sudo tar -C /opt -xJf /tmp/gcc-linaro-4.9.4-2017.01-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz
    rm /tmp/gcc-linaro-4.9.4-2017.01-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz
```

  Download a recent 32-bit GCC toolchain from Linaro, and extract it
  under the /opt directory on your build system:
```shell
    cd /tmp
    wget https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.1-2017.08/arm-linux-gnueabi/gcc-linaro-7.1.1-2017.08-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabi.tar.xz
    sudo tar -C /opt -xJf /tmp/gcc-linaro-7.1.1-2017.08-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabi.tar.xz
    rm /tmp/gcc-linaro-7.1.1-2017.08-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabi.tar.xz
```

  Finally, set some environment variables used to specify the path
  (and file name prefix) for accessing the 32-bit and 64-bit cross
  compiler tool chains in the instructions that follow:

```shell
    CROSS_32=/opt/gcc-linaro-7.1.1-2017.08-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-
    CROSS_64=/opt/gcc-linaro-4.9.4-2017.01-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
```

## Build everything

### Step 1: Build U-Boot.
  The result of this process will be a file `u-boot.bin` that will
  be incorporated into a FIP file created for ARM Trusted Firmware code.

```shell
    # This produces one output file, which is used when building ARM
    # Trusted Firmware, next:
    #       u-boot.bin
    cd ${TOP}/u-boot
    make distclean
    make CROSS_COMPILE=${CROSS_64} poplar_defconfig
    make CROSS_COMPILE=${CROSS_64}
```

### Step 2: Build ARM Trusted Firmware components.
  The result of this process will be two files `bl1.bin` and
  `fip.bin`, which will be incorporated into the image created for
  `l-loader` in the next step. The FIP file packages files `bl2.bin`
  and `bl31.bin` (built here) along with `u-boot.bin` (built earlier).

```shell
    # This produces two output files, which are used when building
    # "l-loader", next:
    #       build/poplar/debug/bl1.bin
    #       build/poplar/debug/fip.bin
    cd ${TOP}/arm-trusted-firmware
    make distclean
    make CROSS_COMPILE=${CROSS_64} all fip DEBUG=1 PLAT=poplar SPD=none \
	BL33=${TOP}/u-boot/u-boot.bin
```

### Step 3: Build "l-loader"
  This requires the two ARM Trusted Firmware components you built
  earlier.  So start by copying them into the `atf` directory.  Note
  that `l-loader` is a 32-bit executable, so you need to use a
  different tool chain.

```shell
    # This produces one output file, which is used in building the
    # flash images:
    #       l-loader.bin
    cd ${TOP}/l-loader
    cp ${TOP}/arm-trusted-firmware/build/poplar/debug/bl1.bin atf/
    cp ${TOP}/arm-trusted-firmware/build/poplar/debug/fip.bin atf/
    make clean
    make CROSS_COMPILE=${CROSS_32}
```

### Step 4: Build Linux.
  The result of this process will be two files: `Image` contains the
  kernel image; and `hi3798cv200-poplar.dtb` containing the
  flattened device tree file (device tree binary).  A Linux build is
  sped up considerably by running `make` with multiple concurrent
  jobs.  JOBCOUNT is set below to something reasonable to benefit
  from this.

```shell
    # This produces two output files, which are used when building
    # the flash images:
    #       arch/arm64/boot/Image
    #       arch/arm64/boot/dts/hisilicon/hi3798cv200-poplar.dtb
    cd ${TOP}/linux
    JOBCOUNT=$(grep ^processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
    make ARCH=arm64 distclean
    make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE="${CROSS_64}" poplar_defconfig
    make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE="${CROSS_64}" all dtbs modules -j ${JOBCOUNT}
```

### Step 5: Gather the required components you built above
  First gather the files that will be required to create the Poplar
  image files.  The root file system image should already have been
  placed in the `recovery` directory.

```shell
    cd ${TOP}/recovery
    cp ${TOP}/poplar-tools/poplar_recovery_builder.sh .
    cp ${TOP}/l-loader/l-loader.bin .
    cp ${TOP}/linux/arch/arm64/boot/Image .
    cp ${TOP}/linux/arch/arm64/boot/dts/hisilicon/hi3798cv200-poplar.dtb .
```

### Step 6: Build image files used for installation
  You need to supply the root file system image you downloaded
  earlier (whose name may be different from what's shown below).
  This will also require superuser privilege to complete.

```shell
    # This produces a directory "recovery_files".  In that directory,
    # "fastboot.bin" can be placed on a USB flash drive (formatted
    # with an MBR with a single FAT32 file system partition) that can
    # be used to boot a Poplar board in a "bricked" state.  The
    # remaining files are used in populating the eMMC media with a
    # bootable Linux system.
    #       recovery_files/fastboot.bin
    #       recovery_files/install.scr
    #       recovery_files/install-*.scr
    #       recovery_files/partition1-1of1.gz
    #		...
    bash ./poplar_recovery_builder.sh all \
		    linaro-stretch-developer-20170914-80.tar.gz
```

**NOTE**: If you are running Ubuntu 14.04, sfdisk needs to be upgraded
to a newer version like 2.26.2 in following steps.

```shell
wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.26/util-linux-2.26.2.tar.xz
tar xf util-linux-2.26.2.tar.xz
cd util-linux-2.26.2
./configure
make sfdisk
export PATH=/path/to/util-linux-2.26.2:$PATH
```

**NOTE**: If you get below error, that means your `mkimage` version is
too old, e.g. if you using Ubuntu 14.04. Use the one you just built in
`${TOP}/u-boot/tools` instead.

```shell
Invalid CPU Type - valid names are: alpha, arm, x86, ia64, m68k, microblaze, mips, mips64, nios2, powerpc, ppc, s390, sh, sparc, sparc64, blackfin, avr32, nds32, or1k, sandbox
Usage: mkimage -l image
          -l ==> list image header information
       mkimage [-x] -A arch -O os -T type -C comp -a addr -e ep -n name -d data_file[:data_file...] image
          -A ==> set architecture to 'arch'
          -O ==> set operating system to 'os'
          -T ==> set image type to 'type'
          -C ==> set compression type 'comp'
          -a ==> set load address to 'addr' (hex)
          -e ==> set entry point to 'ep' (hex)
          -n ==> set image name to 'name'
          -d ==> use image data from 'datafile'
          -x ==> set XIP (execute in place)
       mkimage [-D dtc_options] [-f fit-image.its|-F] fit-image
          -D => set options for device tree compiler
          -f => input filename for FIT source
Signing / verified boot not supported (CONFIG_FIT_SIGNATURE undefined)
       mkimage -V ==> print version information and exit
```

**NOTE**: It is normal to see below warning during this step.

```shell
recovery_files/partition3 is not a block special device.
Proceed anyway? (y,n)
```

### Step 7: Copy image files to the TFTP home directory
  The flashing process depends on transferring files to the Poplar
  board via Ethernet using TFTP.  The `recovery_files` directory
  must be copied to the root of the TFTP directory.

```shell
    cd ${TOP}/recovery
    sudo rm -rf ~tftp/recovery_files
    sudo cp -a recovery_files ~tftp
    sudo chown -R tftp.tftp ~tftp/recovery_files
```

## Flash images onto the Poplar board eMMC


### Step 1: Prepare the Poplar board for power-on

- The Poplar board should be powered off.  You should have a cable
  from the Poplar's micro USB based serial port to your host
  system so you can connect and observe activity on the serial port.
  For me, the board console shows up as /dev/ttyUSB0 when the USB
  cable is connected.  The serial port runs at 115200 baud.  I use
  this command to see what is on the console:

```shell
      screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

### Step 2: Boot the Poplar board into the u-boot prompt where flashing to eMMC is possible

- Power on the Poplar board and interrupt its automated boot with a key
  press.  This should lead to a `poplar# ` prompt.

  The files required for partitioning and re-flashing the content of
  eMMC media on the Poplar board were produced earlier, and should
  now be present in ~tftp/recovery_files.  The Ethernet interface on
  the Poplar board must be configured, and then an installer script
  will be downloaded and executed.

### Step 3: Configure the Poplar Ethernet interface

  The following assumes you know your network configuration, and that
  you have an IP address in that network to use for the Poplar board.

- Inform U-Boot about the network parameters to use.  Use values for
  the following environment variables that are appropriate for your
  network.  The IP address for the Poplar board is assigned with
  `ipaddr`; the netmask for the network is defined by `netmask`; and
  the IP address of the TFTP server containing the image files
  (probably your development/build machine) is `serverip`.

  Enter the following commands in the Poplar serial console to
  configure the Ethernet interface.
```shell
    env set ipaddr 192.168.0.2
    env set netmask 255.255.255.0
    env set serverip 192.168.0.1
```

- Verify your network connection is operational.
```shell
    ping ${serverip}
```

### Step 4: Run the installer

- Load an install script using TFTP, and run it.
```shell
    tftp ${scriptaddr} recovery_files/install.scr
    source ${scriptaddr}
```
  It will take about 5-10 minutes to complete writing out the contents
  of the disk.  The result should look a bit like this:

```shell
    ---------------------------
    | poplar# source ${scriptaddr}
    | ## Executing script at 32000000
    | ETH1: PHY(phyaddr=3, rgmii) link UP: DUPLEX=FULL : SPEED=1000M
    | Using gmac1 device
    | TFTP from server 172.22.22.5; our IP address is 172.22.22.154
    | Filename 'recovery_files/install-layout.scr'.
    | Load address: 0x7800000
    | Loading: #
    |          359.4 KiB/s
    | done
    | Bytes transferred = 368 (170 hex)
    | ## Executing script at 07800000
    | ETH1: PHY(phyaddr=3, rgmii) link UP: DUPLEX=FULL : SPEED=1000M
    | Using gmac1 device
    | TFTP from server 172.22.22.5; our IP address is 172.22.22.154
    | Filename 'recovery_files/mbr.bin.gz'.
    | Load address: 0x8000000

    |          98.6 KiB/s
    | done
    | Bytes transferred = 101 (65 hex)
    | Uncompressed size: 512 = 0x200
    |
    | MMC write: dev # 0, block # 0, count 1 ... 1 blocks written: OK
    |          . . .
```

- When this process completes, reset your Poplar board.  You can reset it in
  one of three ways: press the reset button; power the board off and on again;
  or run this command in the serial console window:
```shell
    reset
```

  At this point, Linux should automatically boot from the eMMC.

  You have now booted your Poplar board with open source code that you
  have built yourself.
